- What is JavaScript?

Javascript is a scripting language,where instuctions are written for runtime environment.
Javascript is easy to implement, no compilation require directly execute the instruction,object oriented language.
In javascript we can pass function as a value in variable.

Variable decalartion:

1. var a = 10;
2. var a; 
   a=10;
 
Primitive data type:

1. Number : in javascript number is double floating type number.
2. Sting : A character is a sting of lenght 1, there is no character type in javascript
3. Boolean : either true or false value.

Javascript is a losely coupled language. it is not dependent on type in the below example we can see
first we assign variable b number value then string so its working no error.

var b =10;
console.log(b);
b = "hello b";
console.log(b);

Output:-
10
hello b
