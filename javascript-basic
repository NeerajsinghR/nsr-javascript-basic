- What is JavaScript?

Javascript is a scripting language,where instuctions are written for runtime environment.
Javascript is easy to implement, no compilation require directly execute the instruction,object oriented language.
In javascript we can pass function as a value in variable.

Variable decalartion:

1. var a = 10;
2. var a; 
   a=10;
 
Primitive data type:

1. Number : in javascript number is double floating type number.
2. Sting : A character is a sting of lenght 1, there is no character type in javascript
3. Boolean : either true or false value.

Javascript is a losely coupled language. it is not dependent on type in the below example we can see
first we assign variable b number value then string so its working no error.

var b =10;
console.log(b);
b = "hello b";
console.log(b);

Output:-
10
hello b

4.Undefined variable : which variable we decalared by default it's value set undefined

var a; //undefined variable

5. NUll : if we assign any null value in variable then we called as null variable. 
--------

- "typeof" Operator: typeof used to find the type of vaiable or value.

e.g.:
console.log(typeof false);
 boolean

var a=10;
console.log(typeof a);
number
-----

- Type Coercion and "===" Operator

Type Coercion: In javascript automatically type conversion happend.

e.g. 123 + "4" (automatically convert 123 to string type("123") then concat with string "4"
   ouptut: 1234


eg: "===" Operator used to restrict automatically type conversion for two variable.

var a= 10;
var b= 10;

//automatically type conversion
if(a==b)
console.log("both value are equal ==");

//strict not type conversion using === operator will return true if both have same type and same value
if(a===b)
console.log("both value are equal ===");
