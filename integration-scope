 Integration mapping:
 
from : This variable is the source variable from which the value will be mapped to the to variable. 

to : This is the destination variable where the value from the from variable will be mapped. After mapping the above request will look something like:
        
        {
            "from" : "request.dateOfBirth",
            "to" : "GenerateQuoteForPosInput.body.quotedtls.lifeassured.dob",
            "defaultValue" : "",
            "rules" : [
                {
                    "name" : "DATE",
                    "value" : {
                        "method" : "format",
                        "srcFormat" : "DD-MM-YYYY",
                        "destFormat" : "DD/MM/YYYY"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "datatype" : "String"
        }
        
        
 
requestMapping
This is the list of all the elements that are to be mapped for the request to hit. Detailed description of a mapping block is described later.

responseMapping
Similar to request, this is the response mapping that is required by the caller of the integrations framework.
